      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p> 
        For my final project I want to create an interactive drinking game using a sensory input and the 4-digit 7 segment display as 
        a timer-like output. The game will track how long it takes someone to chug a beverage and display the result when the beverage is 
        returned to it's designated spot. Red and green LEDs would be used as start and stop indicators for the user to start drinking and
        also correspond with the start/stop of the timer. 
      </p>

      <h2>Bill of Materials </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Arduino</li>
        <li>Red and Green LEDs (for visually displaying start and stop times)</li>
        <li>Sensor Red LED (for illuminating sensor) </li>
        <li>Photoresistor sensor (for tracking can state)</li>
        <li>4 Digit 7 Segment Display (for displaying time & end-game results)</li>
        <li>Resistors (for current-limiting)</li>
        <li>Cardboard (for constructing drink holding container)</li>
        <li>A beverage (for chugging)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Technical Write Up</h2>
      <p>Chugging game overview: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red LED on when game is stopped and a can is present (tracking photoresistor value input)</li>
        <li>When the can is lifted (photoresistor value is over light threshold) is the countdown sequence starts, and green LED turns on </li>
        <li>Timer starts on 4 digit 7 segment display</li>
        <li>When can is returned the timer and game stops and Red LED turns on</li>
        <li>7 seg displays elapsed time for 5 seconds</li>
        <li>7 seg displays end-sequence message based on elapsed time</li>
        <li>Game resets to 0.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p> 
        I knew going into this project I would have to experiment different input sensors to determine  
        whether or not a can was present or not and read the serial monitor output of whatever input device to find 
        a threshold to determine the can's state to start and stop the game. I first used a capactive sensor underneath the can, which proved to be unsuccessful as the sensor was
        detecting the presence of my hand picking up the can and spiked the reading. I next tried taping a photoresistor in the box, but the issue here 
        was I would have to re-calculate the light threshold if the game moved to a darker/brighter enviroment which would be a frustrating user experience.
        I then played around with a square force-sensative resistor, which can detect the weight of the can. The issue with this sensor was that it's readings
        were drifting when a can was on the sensor which made it would pose a problem when the user has a can on the sensor and doesnt want to start the game. My classmate Keyvyn  
        suggested using the can as a gate and blocking light between a LED and photoresistor on either side of the can. This idea would only work 
        if I could create a controlled dark enviroment inside the box. This was achieved by sectioning off the can-sitting area inside my enclosure box with an additional carboard wall.
        The interior sensor LED is always on, when the can is in the box it blocks direct light from the LED to the photoresistor and outside enviroment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the can is lifted, the sensor LED shines directly at the photoresistor, which will trigger enough light even in a dark room to start the game. 
        I noted that the serial output from the photoresistor when the can was in the box was around 100 in a dark and light room
        was around 100 in a dark and light room (proving that I had sucessfuly created a controlled internal enviroment). When the can was out of the box 
        in a dark room the serial output's minimum value was 200. Thus, I set the light threshold for the game at 150 in the firmware to work in both light and dark playing enviroments. 
        Using this logic, I used functions to start and stop the game by tracking the sensor state and controlling the timer. Boolean 
        variables manage game states and transitions as well as displaying start-end messages on the four-digit seven-segment display.
        When the can is placed back, the game stops, toggling the gameRunning and gameFinished states and triggering a five-second display of the final 
        time before allowing a reset. The elapsedTime variable records how long it took the user to finish their drink and determines the final performance message. 
        The messages are displayed as follows:
      </p>

      <h3> First start-up message</h3>
      <img src="final_beer.jpg" />

      <h3> Less than 30 seconds </h3>
      <img src="final_Rad.jpg" />

      <h3> Between 30 seconds and 1 minute </h3>
      <img src="final_Good.jpg" />
        
      <h3> Over 1 minute </h3>
      <img src="final_Eh.jpg" />

      <h2>Circuit Images</h2>
      <img src="final_circuit(1).jpg" />
      <img src="final_circuit(3).jpg" />
      <img src="final_circuit(2).jpg" />

      <p> 
        I had to solder the red and green LEDs to give them extra length to poke through the top of my game box. I also had to solder 
        the photoresistor and red sensor LED to reach the dark sectioned off area where the can sits.
      </p>

      <h2>Setup Assembly</h2>
      <img src="final_assembly(1).jpg" />
      <p> 
        Here is a representation of how the can acts as a gate between the sensor LED and photoresistor, the can blocks light when it is 
        placed in the box and lets in light when it is picked up - acting as the start/stop of the game.
      </p>
      <img src="final_assembly(2).jpg" />
      <p> 
        Added a box flush to the bottom of enclosure, just tall enough for photoresistor and sensor not to be blocked. This allows the 
        can to sit mostly outside of the game. I also added a additional section to the right so that the breadboard could be completely 
        encolsed.
      </p>
      <img src="final_assembly(3).jpg" />
      <p> 
        I then cut out holes for the 4 digit 7 segment display, red, and green LEDs and threaded the hardware through the box. The breadboard, 
        arduino, and all wiring sits in the open section under the box.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <img src="final_cover_image.jpg" />

      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img src="final_schematic.png" />
      <p> 
        Schematic of the 4 digit 7 segment display, Red, Green, Sensor(Red) LED, and the photoresistor. The 4 digit 7 segment display 
        used the majority of my digital pins, so I had to use analog pins for all the LEDs.
      </p>

      <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p>
        I calculated the resistor value for all the LEDs with a 1.8V voltage drop. Given that a LED should run at a 20mA current and the Arduino gives 5 volts. 
        I used 220Ω resistors because it's the closest value greater than 160Ω. I used a 10kΩ resistor in series with my photoresistor in order to use less mA
        and current to conserve power in our circuit. With a 10k resistor I would have 0.5mA current which is a sufficient amount the detect brightness in the controlled
        enviroment inside my box.
        I also used this datasheet and webpage to pick the 330k resistors for the SevSeg display on the digital pins:
        https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2095876.pdf & https://www.instructables.com/Using-a-4-digit-7-segment-display-with-arduino/

      <pre><code class="language-c">
        // LEDs
         V = I x R // Ohm's Law 
         V = V - Vf = 5 - 1.8 = 3.2 V
         I = 20mA = 0.02A
         R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω
         // Chose 220 resistors for the red and green LEDs

        // Photoresistor
        V = I x R // Ohm's Law
        R = 10000Ω
        5 = I x 10000 
        I = .0005A = 0.5mA 
        // Chose 10k resistors for the photoresistor
