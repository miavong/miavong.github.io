      <h2>Serial Output from Calibration</h2>
      <p>These values represent the behavior of my capacitive sensor during both unpressed and pressed states.
        During the calibration, the maximum sensor value recorded was 1094 and minimum sensor value recorded during calibration is 0. This 
        confirms that my calibrations are working because we can see the  raw sensor value (21 unpressed and 1094 pressed) are being mapped to
        the min and max values (0,1094).
      </p>

      <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p>I used a 1M Ω for my capacitive sensor because I wanted the touch of the metal flower to activate the servo motor desired 
        position. With a smaller resistor I am able to reduce sensitivity for a faster response time which makes my sensor function more like 
        a button with a finger's direct touch. If I used any higher resistor such as 10M then the sensor would detect human touch from a inches away.
      </p>

      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img src="A4_Schematic.png" />
      <p> My capacitive sensor is connected to GND even though it doesn't necessarily need to be which is why I inlcuded GND in my specific 
        schematic. The servo motor is connected directly into my arduinio uno and doesn't interact with my breadboard. 
      </p>

      <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
      <p> In the first 5 seconds of running the code I covered and uncovered the capacitive sensor (input device) with my finger around 3-4 times to calibrate the max and min value
        readings. The program uses these calibration values to contrain and control the servo motor position (output device) based on if the capacitive sensor senses human touch directly on the 
        metal flower. My servo monitor prints the actual sensor value when the flower is touched vs untouched and the min and max values that is there sensor is being 
        constrained to during the pressed & unpressed phases.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>A time vs voltage graph for a servo motor in pin 9 would look like:</p>
        <img src="A4_Chart.jpg" />
    
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p> To address a broken input device giving an erroneous reading 1% of the time, you could create a if statement that constrains 
          the outlier erroneous behavior when reading in your raw sensor data. Since we know that the input device is giving errors 1% of the time, then 
          we can use an if statement that continously checks if the sensor value deviates greatly from the expected change in sensor value. You would need to analyze the
          serial monitor values from the input's device in a calibration period to see what the magnitude of erroneous change is and then use that value in an if statement in void loop() such as: 
          if (sensorValue > erroneousValue*prevSensorValue) then sensorValue = prevSensorValue which replaces the outlier data with the previous data 
          value from the input's expected behavior. 
        </p>

          <pre><code class="language-c">
            void loop (
              sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin)

              // Find erroneousValue based on serial monitor analysis in calibration period 
                serial.begin()...
                Serial.print("sensorPin = ");
                Serial.println(pinval);

              // check to seee if raw value is an outlier to constrain sensorValue
                if (sensorValue > erroneousValue * prevSensorValue) {
                  sensorValue = prevSensorValue;
                }

              // use constrained sensorValue for output device etc...
                analogWrite(output, sensorValue);
            )

        <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <p>
        You could "smooth" the data being read from your slighly noisy input device which is causing random deviations of up to ±10. You could create a method 
        that reads in that a set of sensor's raw input values and averages those values to midigate the effect of a 10% deviations from true readings. For the pseudo code, 
        you would want to use a for loop to look at a list of readings I chose around 10 that creates a sum of values within that set number of input readings,
        this could look something like sumReading = sumReading + i. You would then calculate the average, like AverageSensorValue = adding past ten sensorValue / 10. 
        You can use averaged reading by passing it into a analogWrite() for an output device. This uses an average reading rather than a a single sensor reading
        that controls randomly deviated reading from the true measurement up or down by 10%.

                sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // read raw sensor value from input 
                sumReadings = (sumReadings + sensorValue); // add readings 
              }

            // calculate average sensor reading from input device
              AverageSensorValue = (sumReadings / numReadings);
