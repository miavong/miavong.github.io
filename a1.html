      <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p>To calculate the resistor value for each LED we need to know the voltage drop for red, green and yellow LEDs which are all 1.8V. We also know that 
        each LED should run at a 20mA current and the Arduino gives 5 volts. Thus we use Ohm's law to calculate the resistor values:</p>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">
         V = I x R // Ohm's Law 
         V = V - Vf = 5 - 1.8 = 3.2 V
         I = 20mA = 0.02A
         R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <p>I used 220Ω resistors for each LED because it is the closest value greater than 160Ω. Each LED gets it's own digital pin and resistor.</p>

      <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
      <p>Each LED follows its respective blinking pattern. Red LED (Pin 13):
        Turns on for 1 second and then remains off for 2 seconds in each cycle.
        Green LED (Pin 12):
        Blinks twice, with each blink lasting 0.5 seconds, and then stays off for the rest of the cycle.
        Yellow LED (Pin 8):
        Turns on for 1 second after the Green LED finishes blinking and then turns off. This pattern repeats continuously.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

        <h3>Voltage vs Time Graph</h3>
        <img src="A1_Graph.jpg" />
        <p> The arduino digital pins outpus 5V voltages, but the voltage across the 3 LEDs when the LED's output is HIGH is the forward
          voltage (Vf) which is approximately 1.8V for Red, Green, and Yellow LEDs. </p>

        <h3>Total LEDs </h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</p>
        <p>There are 13 pin ports in the Arduino, thus you could theoretically connect 13 LEDs independently. But the the maximum current draw
          of the Arduino is 200mA. If each Arduino pin can safely provide 20mA of current then you can calculate the total limit of LEDs by: 
        </p>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="language-c">
           200mA / 20mA = 10 LEDs 
           Current = 10 X 20mA = 200mA 
          </code></pre>
        </section>
        <p>You can blink 10 pins which would draw 200mA of current safely with our Arduinos.</p>

        <h3>Blinking Speed</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</p>
        <p> People perceive binking at 60HZ which would be 60 blinks per 1 second which is 0.0167 seconds (16.7 milliseconds). Because each 
          blink cycle consists of an HIGH phase and an LOW phase, each phase to need to last half of 16.7ms. Thus, we would need
          to blink our LEDs at 8.3ms
        </p>
        <section>
          <pre><code class="language-c">
           (1 / 60) = 0.0167s = 16.7ms
           0.0167s / 2 = 0.0083s = 8.3ms
