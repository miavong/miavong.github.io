      <h2>Transistor Max Current </h2>
      <p> The maximum drain current of a N-channel MOSFET is around 37A. My circuit is operating at a much smaller current to power the LED strip
        which makes this circuit more than safe to use.
      </p>

      <h2>pinMode() Initalizing </h2>
      <p> The digital pin my LEDs and transistor are connected to is initalized as an output and can control 0-5V. Because 
        pin 9 can be used for PWM, I'm able to use analogWrite to control the brightness of the LEDs. When I write analogWrite(9, 50), 
        the MOSFET is partially turned ON for a small portion of the PWM cycle, modulating the current through the LED strip and 
        making them appear dimmer. The transistor is essenitally as a switch controlled by PWM and a gate voltage that determines if 
        the LEDs receive power and at what intensity.
      </p>

            In setup:
              Use pinMode to set pins 1(EN), 2(EN), 5(2A), 6(1A), 10(3A), 11(4A) as OUTPUTs
              Define and enable motors by using digitalWrite setting motor 1 as (pin 1) and motor 2 (pin 2) to HIGH

            In the loop:
              // To move both motors forward
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 1, set pin 5 to high and 6 to low 
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 2, set pin 11 to high and 10 to low 
              wait 2 seconds 

              // To move both motors backward
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 1, set pin 5 to low and 6 to high 
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 2, set pin 11 to low and 10 to high 
              wait 2 seconds

              // Move motor 1 motor forward, motor 2 backward
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 1, set pin 5 to high and 6 to low  
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 2, set pin 11 to low and 10 to high

              Use digitalWrite to control motor 1, set pin 5 to low and 6 to high  
              Use digitalWrite to control motor 2, set pin 11 to high and 10 to low 
              wait 2 seconds

              // Stop motors before restarting loop
              By using digitalWrite set motor 1 as (pin 1) and motor 2 (pin 2) to LOW
