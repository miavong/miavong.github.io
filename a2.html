      <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p>To calculate the resistor value for each LED we need to know the voltage drop for red and green LEDs which are all around 1.8V and a blue LED 
        (which is a RGB LED) is around 3V. We also know that each LED should run at a 20mA current and the Arduino gives 5 volts. 
        Thus we use Ohm's law to calculate the LED resistor values to limit current flowing through the LEDs:</p>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">
         V = I x R // Ohm's Law 
         I = 20mA = 0.02A // Desired Current 
         V = V - Vf = 5 - 1.8 = 3.2 V // Green and Red Voltage
         V = V - Vf = 5 - 3 = 2 V // Blue Voltage
         R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω // Green and Red Resistance
         R = V / I = 2V / 0.02A = 100Ω // Blue Resistance 
         // Chose 220 resistors for all LEDS 
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <p>I used a 10kΩ resistor for my button because it is the standard for a pull-down resistor as stated on the arduino manual. 
        We also want less mA or current to conserve power in our circuit. With a 10k resistor we would have 5mA current which is great!
      </p>

        <pre><code class="language-c">
         V = I x R // Ohm's Law
         5 = I x 1000 
         I = .005A = 5mA
         // Chose 10k resistors for the button

      <p>I made sure to connect all LEDs to digital pins that were compatible with analogWrite() and PWM indicated by this symbol ~.
        Each LED has a 220 resistor and the button has a 10k resistor. </p>

      <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
      <p>This code makes all 3 LEDs fade when pressing the button.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-c">
        // Defining variable names to pins 
        int blue = 11; // blue pin
        int green = 3; // green pin
        int red = 5; // red pin
        int button = 10; // button pin 

        // Setup code, to run once
        void setup() {
        pinMode(blue, OUTPUT); // blue LED

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <h3>Question 1</h3>
      <p> analogWrite(led, 64) has a PWM signal with a low duty cycle of 25%. 
        analogWrite(led, 128) has a PWM signal with a medium duty cycle of 50%.
        analogWrite(led, 255) has a PWM signal that results in the LED being always on resulting in a constant high voltage (5V) or 100%
        duty cycle. The voltage is based hypothetically on a red LED. </p>
        <img src="A2_Graph.jpg" />

      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p> My LEDs are in a parallel configuration because each LED is independently connected to its own digital pin and ground, which means 
        that the total current (I) is going to be all the LEDs mA added together which is around 38.1mA. However, because my LEDs are fading, they will
        there is a 50% duty cycle across the fade cycle when the button is being held. Assuming that my button is pressed the whole time, if my circuit
        was to be powered by a 1200 mAh battery, it would run for around 31.49 hours multiplied by 2 to account for fading which would be 
        62.98 hours.
